   <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
   <p>
       Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Users typically pay only for the cloud services they use, helping to lower operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as business needs change.

   <h2>Roadmap to Learn Cloud Computing</h2>
   <h3>1. Understand the Basics</h3>
   <p>
       Start with the fundamentals of cloud computing, including an understanding of different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (public, private, hybrid). Learn about the key providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
   </p>
   <h3>2. Learn a Cloud Platform</h3>
   <p>
       Choose a cloud platform to specialize in, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Each platform offers extensive documentation, tutorials, and free tier services to help you get started.
   </p>
   <h3>3. Gain Hands-on Experience</h3>
   <p>
       Practical experience is crucial. Work on small projects to deploy and manage resources on your chosen cloud platform. This could include setting up virtual machines, databases, and storage solutions.
   </p>
   <h3>4. Understand Networking and Security</h3>
   <p>
       Networking and security are critical components of cloud computing. Learn about virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, firewalls, VPNs, and security best practices. Understanding how to secure cloud environments is essential.
   </p>
   <h3>5. Explore Advanced Topics</h3>
   <p>
       Once you have the basics down, delve into more advanced topics such as DevOps practices (e.g., CI/CD), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), serverless computing, and big data services. These are increasingly important in modern cloud architecture.
   </p>
   <h3>6. Get Certified</h3>
   <p>
       Earning certifications can validate your skills and increase your job prospects. Popular certifications include AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals, and Google Associate Cloud Engineer.
   </p>
   <h3>7. Stay Updated</h3>
   <p>
       Cloud computing is a rapidly evolving field. Stay updated with the latest trends, new services, and best practices by following industry blogs, attending webinars, and participating in cloud computing communities.
