    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It involves the development of algorithms that can process large amounts of data and use statistical analysis to predict outcomes. ML is used in various applications, including recommendation systems, image and speech recognition, and predictive analytics.

    <h2>Roadmap to Learn Machine Learning</h2>
    <h3>1. Understand the Basics</h3>
    <p>
        Start with the fundamentals of machine learning. Understand key concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the machine learning workflow, which includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Learn Programming Languages</h3>
    <p>
        Proficiency in programming is essential for machine learning. Python is the most widely used language in ML due to its simplicity and the availability of libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. R is also popular for statistical analysis and visualization.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Study Mathematics and Statistics</h3>
    <p>
        A solid understanding of mathematics and statistics is crucial for machine learning. Focus on linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. These subjects form the foundation of many machine learning algorithms and techniques.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Learn Data Preprocessing and Visualization</h3>
    <p>
        Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis. Learn techniques for handling missing data, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables. Visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly can help you understand data distributions and relationships.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Explore Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        Start with basic algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors. Gradually move to more advanced techniques like support vector machines, ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting), and neural networks. Understanding how these algorithms work and when to use them is key to effective ML practice.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Gain Hands-on Experience</h3>
    <p>
        Practical experience is essential for mastering machine learning. Work on projects that involve real-world data sets to apply your skills. Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions, is a great place to find datasets and challenges to practice on. Building a portfolio of projects can help demonstrate your expertise to potential employers.
    </p>
    <h3>7. Stay Updated</h3>
    <p>
        Machine learning is a fast-evolving field. Stay updated with the latest research, tools, and trends by reading blogs, following industry leaders on social media, attending conferences, and participating in machine learning communities.
