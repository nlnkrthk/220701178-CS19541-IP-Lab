    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. These systems are capable of learning from experience, adapting to new inputs, and performing human-like tasks. AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches), and General AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.

    <h3>1. Mathematics and Statistics</h3>
    <p>
        A strong foundation in mathematics and statistics is essential for understanding AI algorithms. Focus on topics such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Programming Languages</h3>
    <p>
        Learn programming languages commonly used in AI development, such as Python and R. These languages have extensive libraries and frameworks that make AI development easier.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. Start with basic ML algorithms and gradually move to more advanced topics like deep learning and reinforcement learning.
    </p>
    <h3>4. AI Frameworks and Libraries</h3>
    <p>
        Familiarize yourself with popular AI frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. These tools are essential for building and deploying AI models.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Projects and Real-world Applications</h3>
    <p>
        Apply your knowledge by working on projects. This can include anything from simple prediction models to complex AI systems. Real-world applications will give you hands-on experience and help you understand the practical challenges of AI development.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Stay Updated</h3>
    <p>
        AI is a rapidly evolving field. Stay updated with the latest research papers, attend conferences, and join AI communities to keep your knowledge current.
